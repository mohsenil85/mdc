How liberating would it be to have tools to work with your dreams and nightmares? To be more embodied? To set healthy boundaries with the people in your life and feel your feelings instead of exclusively thinking about them?

I help highly sensitive and other neuro-spicy clients find tools to navigate their relationships and environments more skillfully. My specialties include:

- 🌙 **Dreamwork & Nightmare Processing** - Tools to understand and work with your dreams
- 🧘‍♀️ **Somatic Therapy** - Embodied healing and trauma recovery
- 🤱 **Perinatal Support** - Conception, pregnancy, postpartum, and parenting guidance  
- 🌱 **Addiction Recovery** - Support for the sober curious and those in recovery
- 💭 **Dream Circles & Group Therapy** - Community-based healing experiences
- 🌿 **Highly Sensitive Person Support** - Navigate your sensitivities with confidence
