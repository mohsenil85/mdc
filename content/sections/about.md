I am a Licensed Professional Counselor Candidate (LPCC) with a Master's degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Naropa University in 2024, specializing in body-centered psychotherapy. My therapeutic practice is grounded in evidence-based approaches while integrating ritual and intuition.

## Mental Health Practice

As an LPCC, I provide individual counseling services with specialized training in:
- Somatics
- Brainspotting (level 1)
- Psychedelic-assisted therapy (Embark certification)
- Acudetox ear acupuncture protocol for stress relief and trauma support (as an adjunct to therapy)

## Background

My therapeutic approach is informed by extensive training in embodiment practices:
- Senior Yoga Teacher (since 2006)
- Specialized yoga certifications in pelvic floor, children's, acro and prenatal/postnatal yoga
- Certified birth doula (ToLabor, 2013)

I have led yoga teacher trainings, international retreats, and presented at professional conferences including the Minneapolis Yoga Conference (2018) and Association for Creativity in Counseling Conference (2024) where I presented research I completed on Somatic Dreamwork in clinical settings.

I have held dream circles and group therapy since 2020. I work with the sober curious and folks in recovery, and I am also available if you want support navigating conception, pregnancy, postpartum, or the parenting experience.
