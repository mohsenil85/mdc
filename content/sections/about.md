### Background in Embodiment Practices

My therapeutic approach is informed by nearly two decades of training in embodiment work. I have been a senior yoga teacher since 2006, with specialized certifications in pelvic floor health, children's yoga, acro yoga, and prenatal/postnatal yoga. I am also a certified birth doula (ToLabor, 2013).

I have led yoga teacher trainings and international retreats, and have presented at professional conferences including the Minneapolis Yoga Conference (2018) and the Association for Creativity in Counseling Conference (2024), where I shared original research on Somatic Dreamwork in clinical settings. In Summer 2026, I will be presenting on Somatic Dreamwork for the Female Nervous System at the International Association for the Study of Dreams Conference in Ashland, Oregon.
