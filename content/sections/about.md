In my person-centered, somatic psychotherapy practice I weave my 20-plus years of teaching yoga and 10-plus years of working as a birth doula and birth educator. I enjoy working with highly sensitive clients and recently completed research and presented at the Fall 2024 Association for Creativity in Counseling Conference on "Dreamwork in Addiction."

I have held dream circles and group therapy for the last 5 years. I work with the sober curious and folks in recovery, and I am also available if you want support navigating conception, pregnancy, postpartum, or the parenting experience.
